# HR-Dashboard
I developed an HR Analysis Dashboard using Excel, Power Query, Power BI, and DAX, providing insights into various key areas. In the dashboard, I analyzed employee distribution by examining job titles, departments, salary ranges, and recruitment sources. Additionally, I assessed diversity metrics related to gender, ethnicity, and education levels. The dashboard also evaluated employee performance and job satisfaction across departments while highlighting attrition trends based on age, location, and job category. I conducted a thorough analysis of compensation, including salaries, bonuses, and comparisons across departments, and tracked hiring versus attrition trends to identify key workforce challenges.

Key Insights:

- Largest employee group in Manufacturing and Specialty business unit.
- HR leads in job satisfaction and performance.
- Notable attrition in the US; recruitment mainly via LinkedIn and Indeed.
- Gender ratio: 48% Female, 52% Male.
- Masterâ€™s degree holders have the highest average salaries.

This dashboard enhances data-driven workforce planning and management
